The ABP Project comes with default DDD principal.

Application : - It is also known as Service layer as it will contain the service implementation, in ABP we don't need to create any API controller as this service layer will behave like Api Controller once we inherit it from ApplicationService   
Application.Shared : - All the DTO's will be mapped using Abp Auto Mapper. We need to inherit it from Profile, 
					 - All The interfaces and DTOs are Defined hear and Mapping Logic also.

Core :   - In this layer the database entities and setting are defined. Moreover Dbmigration and seeding is also connected with this layer to start with.
		 - All the common setting and constants are also the part of this layer.

Core.Shared: - This layer is sherd with domain layer.
			 - All the localization stuff, Error Codes or any global configuration are reside in this layer.
EntityFramworkCore : - without this layer we need to configure db seperatly,
					 - This layer is used for Entity frame work configuration and implementation.
					 - All DbContext will be generate here
					 - In Entity Framework Module, we just need to configure the service for Auditing, UOW or Dbcontext option to use database.
					 
Migrator : - This is Console based application, it is used to create all the necessary tables and data seeding to start the project. we just need to give database connection string to start the migration process.
		   - it run first to create table in database
Web.Core : 
Web.Host :  - This layer is the entry point for Api project.
			- All the start configuration for Autofact, swagger and logging are configured here
			- Its our starting point.
