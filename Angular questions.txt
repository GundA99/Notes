1.What is Angular:
Angular is a javaScript Binding framework which binds the HTML UI and JavaScript Model. this helps you to reduce your effort on writing those lengthy lines of code for binding.
ilso it helps you to build single page application by using the concept of routing. it also has lot of other features like HTTP, DI,Input, output becouse of which you do not need other framework.

2.Difference between AngularJS vs Angular?
AngularJS means Angular 1 family

						AngularJs 		Angular
						(1.x)			(2,4,5,6,7,8,9)
1.Language				JavaScript	-	TypeScript
2.Architecture			Controller	-	Component based
3.Mobile compliant			no		-	Yes
4.Lazy loading				no		-	Yes

3.What are directives in Angular?
-directives are used to attach your Behaviour to HTML Dom.
-Directives are nothing but Angular syntexes which we write inside HTML to change the behaviour of HTML Dom.
	for ex: ngModel, hidden, value

4.Explain the different types of Angular directives?
-There are three type of Directives in angular. (SAC)
	1. Structural
		- Change the DOM layout by adding and removing elements.
			ex:<tr *ngFor="let temp of SalesModel">
	2. Attribute
		- Attribute derective are does not add or remove any value it 
		- Change the appearance and behaviour of HTML elements.
		- Change the look and feel of html.
			ex: [hidden]
	3. Component
		- Directives with templates. its like user control.
		- its like own UI 
	
5. Explain the importance of NPM and Node_Modules folter?
	Npm helps you to install any javaScript framework in your Computer.
	for example if you want to install jQuery simple go and use npm install jquery command. 
	after hit command all jquery packege install in Node_modules folter.
	Node_Modules is nothing but a folter where all javaScript packege install.
	
6. Importance of packege.json file
	packege.json is a file where all the references or javaScript frameworks listed down.

7. What is TypeScript and why do we need it?
	- as name says TypeScript It Add Type to JavaScript. so TypeScript is a super set of JavaScript.
	- we write code in TypeScript but at the end of the day it will convert into JavaScript.
	- as its strongly typed we will have less errors and becouse we can do OOp with javaScript our productivity and quality also increases.

8.Expain importance of Angular CLI?
	Angular CLI is a command line interface by which we can create initial Angular project template. so rather than starting from scratch we have some boiler plate code it will give a readymate template.
	hence it can improve productivity   

9.Expain the importance of Component and modules?
	Component has used to bind module and views while  module groups a component

10. Expain Importance of decorator in angular?
	Decorator says what exactly have a class
	ex: @ngModule(), @component
	-Decorator define what kind of class is it. For ex if you decorate @Component then it says its an angular component, if you put @NgModule it become a angular Module.

11.What are annotation or MetaData?
	ans same as above

12. What is Template in Angular
	Template is an HTMl view of angular in which we can write directives.
	there are two ways of defining Template one is inline and other is a seprate HTML file.
		-inline Template:
			@Component({
				template:<b>test</b>
				})	
		- define seprate file and add Url
			@Component({
				templateUrl:'./custApp.Component.html'
				})
13. Explain the four types of Data binding in Angular?
	Data binding in angular define how the view and component communicate with each other.
	there are four types of binding 
	1. Expresion/interpolation Data Binding
		data flow from component to the view and we can mix the same with html tags.
		Ex: {{custObject.CustId}}
	2. Property binding: Data flows from component to view
		[ngmodel]="CustomerObj>CustId"
	3. event binding:
		when we want to send event from the view to the component.
		(click)="Func()"
	4. tow way binding:
		in that data flow is like view to component and component to view.
	
14. Explain architecture of Angular?
	link: https://youtu.be/-jeoyDJDsSM?si=iTofbupCnVhJyeHy
	1 first important component in angular is Template. Template is nothing but HTML View.
				|<---- Template talks with component(By {{}}, [] )
	2 Component	
				|<-----Group of component logically say modules
	3 Modules			
	4 Component and template communicate to each other by data binding 
	5 Directives : Change the HTML DOM behaviour
	6 for command module we create service
		helps to share common logic across the project.
	7 DI: DI helps to inject instance across constructor

15 Expain SPA in Angular
	Single page Application
	SPA is a concept where we load UI once and then we don't load again and agin.
	for ex: if we have a site in that we have header, footer, side menu thus section are loaded only once. and needed UI load on demand.
  
16 How can implement SPA in Angular
	to implement SPA in Angular we need to use something called Angular routing.
		#what is routing
		routing is a simple collection which has two things URL and When this URL is called which component to load
		so routing helps you to define the navigation for your angular application so if you want to move from one screen to other screen and 
		you want to respect SPA thet means not loading and refreshing the whole UI routing is needed.
		
17 How to implement routing in angular
	1st step we need to define set of collection and we need to defile which path has connect to which component loaded.
	then in our HTML file define something called as router-outlet. router outlet is a place where our component will load
	in HTML we use <a [RouterLink]=['home']> and in ts we use this.router.navigate(['/home'])
	
18 What is lazy loading in angular
	lazy loading means on demand loading. loading only the necessary HTML, CSS and JavaScript files so that we have better performance.
	When i click on button and then if some thing load then we can say its lazy loading.
	
19 How can implement Lazy loading in Angular
	1st thins to do is divide project into different module
	then use loadChildren keyword in route collection
	ex: {path :'Customer', loadChildren: '.../CustApp/CustApp.Module'}
20 define Services?
	services helps you to share common logic across Angular project.
21 what is DI
22 how to implement DI in Angular
	for inject DI in Angular we need to use Providers attribute which belongs to the NgModule decorator in that we provide what we want to inject and by useing constructor

23 what is the benefit of DI?
	Dependancy injection helps to decouple class dependencies, so that when you add new Dependancies you do not have change everywhere.
24 Difference between Ng serve and Ng build?
	ng serve build angular application in memory we can say RAM. ng build build application on hard disk. so when you want to go for production "Ng build" command is used 
	
25 Expain the --prod parameter in ng build?
	ng build -prod flag try to compresses your JS file, remove comments, create GUIDs of your JS files and make your application ready for production.
