#Software develpment life cycle
Plan->Code->testing->Build->Deploye->Monitor->Oprate

BA and Customer comunication
	- plan (starting of every thing we have a plan) 
	
Developmemt & testing Team
	- Code (once plan is ready we write a code.)
	- Build (Once code ready we send a build to tester)
	- Testing (once tester Done testing Deploye build on server)
Opration Team
	- Deploye (Once Deploye is done we have some opration to perform )
	- Oprate	(Some on has from a team how monitor what exact is happing on server ex: we need to incress capacity, scale storage etc)
	- Monitor
	

DevOps Team its combination of Developmemt team and Opration team.
is something where development and Opration work together.
basically devOps fills the gap between Devlopment and the oprations Team.

lots of tools are available to automate this process.
#Benefits
1.fast delivery- Deploye code from Dev m/c to server is very fast.
2.Reduce time- lots of things(like testing,deployment,rollback) are happening automatically.
3. Rollback - any release which you think should not go to end customer(becouse of any reason), you can roll it back easily.
 ------------------------------------------AZURE DevOps-------------------------------
 Basically its a development lifecyle of any product.
 asure DevOps is developed and managed by microsoft.
 
 ------------------------------AZURE and Azure DevOps----------------------------
-AZURE is cloud solution which provides lots of services and features to helps your organization in almost all ways during development of
any product by providing multiple tools and technology.

-Azure DevOps is a feature or service of Azure.
------------------------------AZURE DevOps Services----------------------------------
mainly there are 5 services.
1.Boards
2.Repos
3.Pipeline
4.Test Plans
5.Artifacts

*******************************************************1.Boards*******************************************************
Are used to manage our work
	in Boards we can write our story, Task, Bugs, Epics and can manage your progress.
	we can see Bords, Backlog, Sprint, Queries, Delivery Plans 

Azure Boards is one of the main service of Azure DevOps Which is used in a project to 
- Track the work with Kanban board, 
- Work with backlog
inside AZURE board we can manage Kanban board.

#What is Kanban Board?
Kanban Board is something which contain the detail of all the work Item that we can deliver on perticular project

#Use Of Azure Boards
-Managing and tracking work 
	-if you are working in the team on the same location or Distributed team then managing a task is tedious. so that we use Azure Board for managing Task.
	-Becouse It provide a clear picture of work Done/ Progress/ by team member so we can tract the work of each team member.
	-We can give access of board to our stakholdre allow him to see the progress of your development.
	-you can manage scrum, sprint with azure boards.
	-manage your product backlog
	-Get different type of reports.
	
#Types of Boards 
-There are four Type of work item process while a new project.
-Type of the board is depends on these work item process(when we are creating a project in Advaced setting we select Work item process as basic, Agile, scrum, CMMI)
-Each type provide different types of work item and work flow.
// in Work item we can see dropdown as Epic, Issue, Tasks
Epic :- in that we add module ex. suitability module and in that Epic we add sub Tasks.


*******************************************************2.Repos*******************************************************
-Repo is something related to our code. in this repos you can use TFS repository, or we can use git repository using that we can manage our code we can create branches, we can create multiple repositories.
-Here we actully provide the path of repository where we store the code in order to enable the version control.
-in that we can see options like Commits, pushes, Branches, tags, Pull request

Its a set of version control tool that you can we to manage your code.
in that we can see the option like 
1.clone to your computer. 
	-in that we add path of the repository where our code we push. 
	-or there are one option in that we can get code from IDE so we select visual Studio.
2. We can push code from CMD
3. Import(OPtion)
	add Git clone URL
// We can create README and gitignore during set path and this files we can see in File Option inside repos.

we can create multiple repositories.

------------------------Different Between README and gitignore file-----------------------------
1.README :- Readme file contain information about you produc project or what is going to be inside the files of the project.
2.GitIgnore :- in gitIgnore file contain information about what to ignore for certain file formate for certain IDEs
	

*******************************************************3.Pipeline*******************************************************
Pipeline is Something related to the Deployment of the code. CICD will be available in 
- in that we have options like Environment, Library
------------------------------------------------------Building Pipeline------------------------------------------------------------
A pipeline lets you set rules for building and compiling an application. Once the application is built, it's called an artifact. This artifact (the compiled version) can then be deployed. You can also set rules for how and when the deployment happens.
in short the purpose of Pipeline is to automatically build and test whole project  

steps
1.in repos we have option as Set up build when click on it we redirect on pipeline page
2.on that we have to set configuration of pipeline, Set Technology as Asp.Net .
	there are 4 stepers Connet(connection of repositori), select, Configure(configure technology), Review
3.when we redirect on this page we can see Connect and select stepper is complete.
4.when we select technology yml file will create which contain Trigger and steps of you can build Pipline.
5.then we click on Save and run(we have to add commite massage and Discription for pipeline) pipeline will create 
6. in review stapper we can see yml file containt 
7.Then we can see Jobs after this jobs(all steps Execution) completed we can see success of creation pipline
so any time we change code in the branch then this pipline will be trigger.

-----------------------------------------------Release Pipline in Azure DevOps---------------------------------- 
Click on Release pipline option
The release pipeline will actually hook into the build pipeline and allow the application to be deployed to the environment.
1.Click on new release Pipline 
	we can see bunch on templates we can choese or select empty jobs
2.next step is to add an articat(Compiled code of our application), 
	before that we need to Publish Artifact
		Go into yamal file and add Task for Publish Artifact , Then save file and rerun pipeline.
3.then we can see the Schedule set option in that we can set day , time for trigger release pipeline.
4.then we need to add stages
	in that we select Template Ex. Azure App Service deployment.
		in that set the name of the website, Then application pool name and all other things that you required
for IIS deployement we need to add Deployment group 
	for that go to Deployement groups option and create group and add 
5.Click on Save
then go on releses tab there we see Release pipline
6.When we click on Artifact we can see trigger settings we will Enable Continuous Deployment trigger	
7. click on Deploye(Then deploment started)
8.we can see URL of our deployed application.	

*******************************************************4.Test Plans*******************************************************
Testing is one of the main feature in Development. All the automation/manual testing is taken care by test plan
- in that we have options like Test Plans, Progress report, Runs



*******************************************************5.Artifacts**************************************************
is a collection of packages which you getting from the private or public repositories which you can share with your team members.
and all this articat required for deployment also. Basically in the Artifacts you can store your packages.
Like JAR file in Java,
nuget in .net
in modern software development we use Docker
so we store Docker Image as Artifact

----------------------------------------Project setting---------------------------------------------------
-in Project setting we can select the services by allow disallow button. 
-then we can delete the project  
-we can see the team and the members.
-we can see the permition for member.
-------------------------------------------------Waterfall Methodology------------------------------------------
waterfall module is traditional method for delivering product/software.
in waterfall module everything is pre planed
STRENGTHS
-Reserch is done in detail before the project starts.
-Timelines and cost estimates are predicate beforehand  
Example of Waterfall module represent :- Gantt chart
-------------------------------------------------Agile Methodology ------------------------------------------
if we talk about very flexible methodology is a agile methodology.
in that multiple teams working on small piece of product.
-Intead of try to realese everything on once agile methodology release product on chunks. so product owner will using those chunk of product.
-in Agile business and developed team work side by side. 
-initial working product Deliver quickly.

---------------------------------------------------Create Azure DevOps Account--------------------------------------------
1.Browser-> dev.azure.com 
2.Start free/start free with Github (Start free)
3.Sign in Microsoft account
4. Project name -> private -> India -> continue (redirect to your Azure Account)

--------------------------------------------------What Azure DevOpe Project-------------------------------------

#We Can Create multiple Orgnization

#What is a project:- a project is a place where actual complete product development is done by team.
Types
	Privta Project 
	Public Project

Public Project:- Public project are visible to everyone.
No login is required to get access of public project
Each public project has a unique URL
Public project are mostly used for open source project development.
we can create unlimited number of public project under one or more organization.

private project:-
Private project are visible for limited user
user must login into azure devops to get access of project.
Each private project has a unique URL
----------------------------------Create and manage project in Azure DevOps----------------------------
Select Orgnization first in that Create project.
Name(School Management School)
-> Discription(Management system for xyz School) 
->Select public Project.
-> Security policies (Allow public project on)
-> Version control (Git) 
-> Work item process(Basic).
-> Create Project

----------------------------seeting up team for project----------------------------
in Project setting 
-> Teams(Option) 
	- we can create team 
	- we can add member in team by invite button in that we provide the emailId of the member that we want to add.and press add button
------------------------------Deployement to a Deployement Group--------------------------
Deployement Group:- basically represent a phyasical machine that will be deploying too.
Deployement group define a logical group of target machin for parallal deploment
to Create Deployement group-
1.go to Deployement group in Pipline section
2.Provide name of group
3.Select type of target m/c(window/linux)
4.then script will be created this script we need to hit by pawer shell of other m/c 
	simple open powershell by administration mode and hit script.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting started in the azure Portal
When we create free Account we will get popular services free for 12 months and 40+ other services free for all time and $200 
popular 
	AZURE Virtual machin (Linux/Windows)
	Azure SQL Database 
	AZURE Blob storage
if we click on see all services will see services where we can see Free/monthly amount of the service Type description.


--------------------------------------------------------------
Azure DevOps Step by Step :  https://youtu.be/aonA7Kb7WGE?si=T_38whECADGHyRZU
why
when we create software we have Developer and opration team.

Developer do activity like 
Planing, Execution, Test

then Operation will do 
UAT, deploment, support

Both are blaming each other if any problem rise.
for bridg the gap between Developer and Operation team we required DevOps team.
DevOpes is a Philosophy which say that both of team work together for smooth Delevery.
if any error occure after deploment Operation team rise to developer temp to fix this in next buid

we use Board in planing phase  

#Agents
Agent is a software which run inside machine and executes the pipline task.

The output of the pipline is Artifact
Pipline consist series of Task.
-by useing Pipline we can automate Testing -> build -> publish -> UAT part

-----------------------Create our own Agent--------------
1. Goto Project setting
2. Agent pools -> Add pool ->select Self-hosted -> Enter Name for Agent(MyComputerAgent)
3. Goto Newly created pool -> New agent-> Download Agent-> Extract zip file (in that file we see config.cmd and run.cmd file)
4. run the config.cmd then run.cmd file
	(Simply open CMD end select file and enter)
	- Enter Server URL : like http://dev.azure.com/DreamOrg
	- Enter authentication type (PAT(Personal access token)): for thet goto userSetting in azure portal-> create Personal Access token-> Enter name, Select Read and Manage option for Agent pools
5. Register Agent:
Enter agent pool : mycomputeragent (Name of Agent pool on Portal)
Enter agent name () : Press enter

6. Enter work folder : press enter
7.Enter run agent as service: Y
8. run.cmd (after this step Agent will live )

9. Edit job ahe add Self hosted Agent name like pool : mycomputeragent 
	validate and Save 
	(After this step Pipline job 
	inside that we can see executing steps like NuGetToolInstaller, NuGetCommand, VSBuild )
10. Add Task for Publish
    - goto Edit Yamal file
	- search Task (Publish build Artifact)
	- and simply click on Add
	- Validate and save
 Task like
	-task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
	inputs:
	  targatePath : '$(Pipeline.Workspace)'
	  artifact : 'schoolmanagement.app'
	  publishLocation: 'pipeline'
11. After job complete we can see artiface in Artifact section.



---------------------understanding of Yamal-------------------
yamal file: is a data serialization formate for storing Configuration information.
- it helps to communicate data between People and computers.

yamal has name and value structure.
ITS A space indented.
yamal uses Hyphens for list.
**********1****************
#Yamal
name : Akash 
age : 50    
----------------------
#Json
{
	"name" : "Akash",
	"age" : 50
}

************2**************
customer :
	name : Akash 
	age : 50   
	addresses : 
		- Mumbai      <--- '-' represents Collection
		- Solapur
----------------------
#Json
{
	"customer" : {
		"name" : "Akash",
		"age" : 50
		"addresses" : [
			"Mumbai",
			"Solapur"
			]
		}
}

*************3*************
customer :
	name : Akash 
	age : 50   
	profile : 
		designation : engineer
		dept : mechanical
	addresses : 
		- Mumbai      <--- '-' represents Collection
		- Solapur
----------------------
#Json
{
	"customer" : {
		"name" : "Akash",
		"age" : 50,
		"profile" : {
			"designation" : "engineer",
			"dept" : "mechanical"
		},
		"addresses" : [
			"Mumbai",
			"Solapur"
			]
		}
}
------------------------------------Azure Yamal File---------------------------
inside yamal file we have trigger(from master branch), tasks, pool configuration and veriable 
task is provided by Microsoft we simply add in yamal file from rightside tasks dropdown
------------------------------------Release Pipeline--------------------------
release pipeline which actually hook on the build pipeline and  will allow to be deployee on an environment.
Steps
1.Create new release Pipeline
	if option not available 
		goto Orgnization setting -> under pipeline setting -> Desable creation of classic pipeline.
2. select Empty job
3. Add articat 
	Project name, Source

#We have Schedule option
	its bydefault Desable but we can enable for trigger realese pipeline

4. add the stages
	Select Azure App Service deploment
5. Add Artifact 
	// We can set setting like Version of articat, source (from where can select articat)
6. Click on spark symbal 
	Enable(Continuous deploment trigger) //Create a release every time a new build is available.
7. click on Tasks
	Add AZURE free subscription 
	Add type (Web App on Windows)
	Add Service name 
		for that goto Azure portal -> Create a Resource -> web app
		Create new Resource group(eg: schoolmgm-demo)
		name : schoolmanagement-app
		runtime stack : .NET 8 (LTS)
		region : EAST US 2
		Review + Create

# Azure DevOpes Web App		
A Web App in the Azure Portal is a service provided by Azure App Service, which allows you to build, deploy, and manage web applications in a scalable and secure environment. 
It's a fully managed platform that supports various programming languages such as .NET, Node.js, Python, Java, PHP, and Ruby, enabling you to host websites.
is nothing but paas service provided by azure.
we have 4 type of web applications
1. web app
2. static web app
3.web app + database
4.wordPress on App service

if we want to hit custom command we need to specify this like
-task Npm@1
inputs:
	command: 'custom'
	customCommand: 'run build'
