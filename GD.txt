Good morning everyone my name is and our group discussion toping is.... and im in the fever of.... my 1st point is....
#1. The role of artificial intelligence and automation in the future workforce.
Adv
- Increased Efficiency: AI and automation can enhance productivity by performing tasks faster and with fewer errors than humans. 
		For instance, automated systems in logistics can optimize inventory management, 
		reducing costs and improving delivery times.
- AI and automation creates new job categories and opportunities. For example, roles in AI maintenance, data analysis, and cybersecurity
	   as AI used in industries, there will increased demand for professionals peoples is requird to manage and troubleshoot these technologies.
- Now AI used in hiring processes where HR team can select quality people from 100 of people they have some tools where they can select people without open resume they have some Keyword Al can find those people who have realated word, its save time.
- AI can enhance human capabilities rather than just replace them. For example, Al used in medical fied where doctor can take proper dicision based on AI indication
- Automation can improve safety by taking over dangerous tasks. For example, robots can handle hazardous materials or work in unsafe environments, reducing workplace injuries.
- we can perform effecient work by using AI we Can reduce human Errors and Make Tasks Easier 
- chat bot, siri, Ok Google its Example of AI 

Dis
- High Cost and expensive to maintain for ex paint shop in company
- it make humans lazy
- AI and automation  have potential to replace jobs from service sector like chat bot uses in Customer Care chat bot handle our queries so basic work is done by them.
- while automation can boost output it will increase Quantity but somewhere it reduce Quality. 
- AI Reduce some HR jobs bcz in big companies uses AL for shortlist the candidates based on Keyword
- AI Disadvantage is for Ex Deepfakes mean few day age one vedio is viral in that they use Rashmikas face in that vedio but she was not there
- there are some disadvantage becouse few day ago one case we see Someone used Actor Rashmikas photo on another video
summary
In conclusion AI brings significant advantages, such as increased efficiency, improved accuracy, and cost savings, but it also presents challenges, including job displacement, bias, and privacy concerns.

Big Compnies like TATA, hyundai and MG lunchies the Ev's maruti also planning to lunch EV in this Year 
Electric vehicle (EV) adoption is a crucial topic in the context of India’s evolving transportation sector and environmental goals.

Adv
1. Easy to maintain
 in Conventional motor vehicle it contain more than 20000 moving parts and other hand in Ev it has upto 20 moving parts, 
	in Ev then major componant is battery and electric engine which make it easy to maintain.
2. Eco-friendly:
	the ev are 100% Eco-friendly bcz it run on electric motor and it does't emmit toxic gases and smoke on environment.
3. Government Policies and Incentives
Explanation: The Indian government has introduced various policies and incentives to promote EV adoption under FAME scheme, such as subsidies
4. charging Stations
	tata group was invested 7000Cr for implementing charging stations and becouse of that EV was grow drastically
5.Economic Opportunities and Job Creation 
	The EV industry presents significant economic opportunities, including job creation in manufacturing, charging infrastructure, and research and development. 
6.Cost can cover:
	as we know the price of petrol and disel incress day by day, and if we see coste which speend on petrol and disel in next 10year EV is rigth choise for now. 
	and charging cost is chep as compair to petrol/disel/gas.
7. There are good facility Ex we charge our vehicle in home and it will run upto 100/200km and our Reserch and Devlopment team also work on it to incress the range.
	
- Lack of chargig infrastructure
- General people can not buy electric vehicle
- High Cost becose Batteries prices are high
- There are Range anxietys essue : threr are Fear for runnig out of charging while Driving  
- there are less service statios or Garaj for repairing our vehicle
- less productivity.
Conclude: It was Helthy discussion, it has some adv and disadvantage, The Gov focus on incentive such as FAME scheme and setting up charging stations but india is still far away from 100% EV adoption
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
#Local city vs metro city
Local city:
1.Crime rate are low:
	Local city as better then metro city bez the Crime rate are low and if we talk about metro city the crime rate is high so local city is bast to live peasefull life.
	and it is safer for family and settel if we talk about metro city is not safer for family to live.
2. there are every thing are available on chip price
3. we can use youtube its a great platform for education.
4. in local city the people help to each other it have halping nature in local city, but in metro city people are busy to earn mony,
	They don't have time to talk each other it couse deprestion. in local city we shear our problems.  
5. Polution is less, pure oxigen.
Metro city:
1.many Facilities:
	there are many facility like school, hospital, we have proper education in metro city. 
2.	it provide employement
3. Transport facility good roads and transportation facilities.
4. Everyone can't affort live in metrocity there are every this is very costly.
5 we requird platform for our future in metro city we can get good plaform for furture study,  we can start buisness.

WFH vr WFO
WFH
time consume : while trvling to office and home it take to much time, travel time we can save and  
Cost : petrol disel price incress
Family woman have to do work in home and then come to office soome woman can't handle both so that they need to leve job 
team work is also deficult while wfh bcz of
now days people enjoying wfh bez they not feel such presure like wfo	  
Places matter: we can do some time to famliy
no crowds traffic and accidents problem.
spend more time with family member.
wfh is good for women elder people and handicapped person.
enjoy home made food 
 
wfo: 
Physical face to face communication, no family destraction.
no boringness, loneliness and social isolation, no network issues. helper available
not every work can do at home
its a learning environment
we can't work without supervision	
There should be gap between home and office bcz we can manage office work and home.
life balance: if we wfo we can make life balance bcz when we work it will have some tension/pressure but when we go to home we will be relax. so we lost this thing  
people not work properly bcz lack of profesional environment so team work is deficult 
some companies give lots of work bcz the employee is working from home 
wfh for long time it hamper social and interpersonal skills, make people isolated
its defucult to establish connection between new collegues bcz the opportunity to meet and talk with them during coffee breks will be lost.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mony vs happyness

Mony:
Basic need of human is cloth, food, and shelter so that we need mony to fuilfill this needs. 
No mony means lot of struggle in life, and struggle couse unhappyness.
MOony makes our life comfortable and stressless. it means mony is needed for happiness we can buy thing which make you happy.
mony maintain a good relationship : with mony we can fuifill the all demands of our family member, relative and friends mony is requird for celebrating parties, function, festivals and programing
mony can be donated for public welfare: with mony we can help poor and needy people. it make you happy

Happyness
Happyness is an inner feeling which cant be purchase by money. there is no connection between money if we see long time ago there is no consept of mony but that time people was live happyly.
Mony Give temporory outer happiness. permanant happiness belongs to self satisfaction
there are lots of people in world they have lots of mony but they dont have satisfaction.
a person maintain relationship by his good behaviour not by money. 
Happyness is a feeling of a positive mindset: its all dpends on your thinking what kinds of person you are.
mony can make better the outer world not the inner world

conclusion : when we get this job it will our inner happiness there is no connection of mony but when we get peyment it will our temporory happiness.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Socia media
adv:
we can do study by help of Social media no need to go one place to another we can save time, we can crack any gov exam.
we can start our buisness, we can easily connect with peoply with the help of social media, WA, FB this are social media app we can use.
we can advertise our buisness.
youtube is a big platform where we can learn anything so i this is good for us.  
we can present ourself, talent, if we have talent like singing, dancing you can upload and get good opportunities.
Bcz of social media Dolly has femus and it got lots of mony they have only tea stoll but now he selling branches.   
use for getting employeement, if we not good in communication then we can lern it by social media. josh

dic:
it wasting time on social media they wasted time time to watch FB, Insta.if we deside i will spend only 10 or 15 min but we will forgate the time and it convert into 2 or 3 hour which is bad.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Confidence vs knowledge
Both are important in life to success 

knowledge:
- Self Confidence comes with knowledge, if we have knowledge we look confident 
-if we are knowledgable confidence automatically increases.
-if we have depth knowledge we can sheare this knowledge confidently, 
-Ex if you will go for any interview and if we Don't have knowledge, so you cannot express your thoughts and not achive a good Opportunities ,
   and firt interviewr check knowledge and then they confusing and check conficence so first knowledgable is important.
-suppose some one come and ask quation bcz you looking confidence but you don't know the ans so your conficence is worthless, so how you ans ths question. 
-Ex Doctor, person for Become a doctor they need study for 3 to 4 year and get the knowledge, and after that when he come into operation theater that time it requird Confidence and conficence is come when we have knowledge so conficence is impotant but knowledge is more important. 
-i this knowledge is a product and self conficence is method of delivery, product delivery is important to get product and product is more important to Devliver similar to that knowledge is more important.

Confidence:
-if we have confidence we can express our things to everyone, without confidence we cannot express things and it will not make good impact.
-Confidence is important bcz if you have lot of knowledge but you need to express your knowledge in front of to meny people so how you express your knowledge.
-Ex. one peron can sing song very well in home but if he don't have confidence then he can't sing song in front of many people so Confidence is important Then knowledge.
