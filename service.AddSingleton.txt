public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // Register the implementation as a singleton
    services.AddSingleton<IOrder, Order>();
}


AddSingleton is an extension method provided by ASP.NET Core's DI container (IServiceCollection). 
It registers a service with the DI container as a singleton.


Meaning of services.AddSingleton<IOrder, Order>();
Registration: This line of code registers Order as an implementation of the IOrder interface with the DI container as a singleton.

Singleton Lifetime: When registered as a singleton:

Instance Creation: The DI container will create a single instance of Order when it is first requested.
Reuse: Subsequent requests for IOrder will return the same instance of Order throughout the application's lifetime.
Dependency Injection: Elsewhere in the application, if a class or component depends on IOrder, the DI container will inject the singleton instance of Order automatically.

Example Usage
csharp
Copy code
// Define the interface
public interface IOrder
{
    void ProcessOrder();
}

// Implement the interface
---------------------------------------------------
public class Order : IOrder
{
    public void ProcessOrder()
    {
        // Implementation details for processing an order
    }
}

--------------------------------------------------------

// In ConfigureServices method of Startup class
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // Register the implementation as a singleton
    services.AddSingleton<IOrder, Order>();
}

--------------------------------------------------------

In this example: Order implements IOrder.

services.AddSingleton<IOrder, Order>(); 
ensures that whenever IOrder is requested by other parts of the application, they receive the same instance of Order.

Meaning of services.AddSingleton<IOrder, Order>();

Registration: This line of code registers Order as an implementation of the IOrder interface with the DI container as a singleton.

Reuse: Subsequent requests for IOrder will return the same instance of Order throughout the application's lifetime.
